# Heart Attack Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- Data Preparation: Includes data import, cleaning, and initial selection of relevant variables.
- Exploration: Univariate and multivariate analysis to understand data distributions and relationships.
- Transformation: Steps for handling missing values, outlier treatment, normalization, and feature encoding.
- Modeling: Implementation of various classification models including:
    - Random Forest
    - Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
    - Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
    - Feedforward Neural Networks
    - Stacked Ensembles
- Evaluation: Performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC).
